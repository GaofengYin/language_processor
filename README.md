Language processing pratical work.

Using Yacc/Lex

The first part is focused on creating the grammar for a specific language/notation and will
have to result in a parser capable of processing files of that language/notation.

The second part is a continuation of the first one where it is intended to give a
practical application to the parsing process, which goes beyond the “simple” lexical and
syntactic validation.
